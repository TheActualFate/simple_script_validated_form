# simple script validated form

I created this form through learning from my lecturer.

It included the process of form validation and how to use git to manage
a project.

This form can easily implemented on any web page by simply copying the code
into the page.

Please note: If you change the form input names or ID names, you would need to adjust
the names and/or ID names within the main.js file
